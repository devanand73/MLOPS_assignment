Okay, let's tackle this README documentation request. The user wants a downloadable file that explains their data ingestion pipeline, version tracking, and schema management. They mentioned using DVC for data versioning and AWS tools like S3 and SageMaker. 

First, I need to structure the README logically. Starting with an overview makes sense to give a high-level picture. Then, diving into each component: ingestion, versioning, schema management. Including tools used and architecture diagrams would help visualize the setup.

I should outline the data ingestion workflow step-by-step, from the hourly trigger to processing and storage. For version tracking, explaining how DVC integrates with S3 and Git is crucial. Including commands and examples will make it practical. Schema management needs a section on validation, versioning, and handling changes, maybe with examples using Great Expectations.

Reproducibility is important, so a guide on checking out specific versions and environment setup would be useful. Common operations and monitoring sections can help users interact with the pipeline. An FAQ addresses potential questions, and an example workflow ties everything together.

I need to ensure the markdown is properly formatted, with code blocks for commands and clear headings. Since the user wants it downloadable, providing a way to save the content as a .md file is necessary. Maybe include a note on how to download or generate the file using scripts.

Also, checking for consistency with previous responses to maintain the same tools and structure. Making sure all links are placeholders if they don't have actual URLs yet. Finally, proofread for clarity and completeness to cover all user requirements.

Here's the complete README documentation in markdown format that you can save as a .md file:

## System Overview <a name="system-overview"></a>
A robust MLOps implementation featuring:
- **Hourly Data Ingestion** from multiple sources
- **Automated Data Validation** with anomaly detection
- **DVC-based Version Control** for datasets
- **Schema Evolution Tracking** with version rollback
- **Reproducible Training Environments**

## Tools & Technologies <a name="tools--technologies"></a>
| Component              | Technology Stack          |
|------------------------|---------------------------|
| Data Ingestion         | AWS Lambda, EventBridge   |
| Data Storage           | S3 (versioned buckets)    |
| Data Versioning        | DVC + S3 Remote           |
| Workflow Orchestration | AWS Step Functions        |
| Schema Validation      | Great Expectations        |
| CI/CD                  | GitHub Actions            |
| Monitoring             | CloudWatch, Prometheus    |

## Data Ingestion Pipeline <a name="data-ingestion-pipeline"></a>
### Workflow
1. **Trigger**: Hourly EventBridge schedule
2. **Data Collection**:
   ```python
   # Lambda function snippet
   new_files = s3.list_objects(Bucket=raw_bucket, Since=last_processed)
   ```
3. **Validation**:
   - Schema checks
   - Data integrity tests
   - Anomaly detection

4. **Processing**:
   ```bash
   # SageMaker Processing Job
   python process_data.py --input s3://raw-bucket/ --output s3://processed-bucket/
   ```

5. **Versioning**:
   ```bash
   dvc add data/processed
   dvc push -r s3-remote
   git commit -am "Data version $(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M)"
   ```

## Data Versioning Strategy <a name="data-versioning-strategy"></a>
### Version Components
| Component       | Versioning Method          |
|-----------------|----------------------------|
| Raw Data        | S3 Object Versioning       |
| Processed Data  | DVC + Git Commit Hash      |
| ML Models       | MLflow + DVC Tags          |
| Schemas         | Semantic Versioning        |

### Access Specific Versions
```bash
# Get data from specific commit
dvc checkout data/processed.dvc@a1b2c3d

# List available versions
dvc list --rev HEAD~5..HEAD data/processed
```

## Schema Management <a name="schema-management"></a>
### Change Protocol
1. Detect schema changes during ingestion
2. Validate against current schema version
3. Handle compatibility:
   ```python
   if schema_change_type == 'BREAKING':
       quarantine_data()
       alert_team()
   elif schema_change_type == 'NON_BREAKING':
       update_schema_version()
   ```

### Schema Versioning
```bash
# Schema version history
schemas/
├── v1.0.0.json
├── v1.1.0.json
└── v2.0.0.json
```

## Reproducibility Guide <a name="reproducibility-guide"></a>
### Recreate Environment
1. Checkout code version:
   ```bash
   git checkout 98c3a2d
   ```
2. Restore data:
   ```bash
   dvc pull -r s3-remote data/processed.dvc@98c3a2d
   ```
3. Reproduce processing:
   ```bash
   dvc repro process_data
   ```

## Operations & Monitoring <a name="operations--monitoring"></a>
### Key Metrics
- Ingestion latency
- Data validation success rate
- Schema change frequency
- Storage costs

### Common Commands
```bash
# Trigger manual ingestion
aws lambda invoke --function-name data-ingestor

# Check data lineage
dvc pipeline show data/processed.dvc

# Rollback data version
dvc checkout data/processed.dvc@v1.1
```

## FAQ <a name="faq"></a>
**Q: How to handle failed ingestion?**
```bash
# Check quarantine bucket
aws s3 ls s3://quarantine-bucket/$(date +%Y-%m-%d)

# Reprocess data
dvc repro --force
```

**Q: What's the data retention policy?**
- Raw data: 30 days (S3 lifecycle rules)
- Processed data: 1 year (DVC + S3)
- Schemas: Permanent versioning

**Q: How to add new data sources?**
1. Update ingestion Lambda configuration
2. Add new schema version
3. Update DVC pipeline
4. Run integration tests
